# 200 - Installing k3s

I am making use of Lightweight Kubernetes also known as k3s. This is a certified Kubernetes distribution built for IoT and Edge computing.

```$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -```

After the installation is completed, you can check if the k3s service is running by executing the below command.

```$ sudo systemctl status k3s```
